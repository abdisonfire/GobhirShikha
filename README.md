## Abstract
This research paper introduces a novel approach for colorizing grayscale images using deep learning. Our method employs a custom-designed convolutional neural network, originally intended for image classification, to disentangle and merge content and style elements from diverse images. By combining grayscale image content with stylistic characteristics derived from similar color images, we add colors in a visually pleasing manner. The colorization process involves a residual autoencoder with curriculum learning. Our approach utilizes the Image Colorization Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayush9753/image-colorization-dataset). We trained the model with color images, followed by edge-enhanced colored images, edge-enhanced grayscale images, and grayscale images, respectively. This progressive learning strategy helps the model gradually acquire complex colorization patterns and enhances convergence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an MSE Loss of 0.0085 and an MSSSIM Score of 0.9167. To assess image quality, we conduct visual comparisons between our CNN and residual connection approaches, as score-based judgment proves challenging. Overall, our research showcases an innovative and effective method for realistically colorizing grayscale images, leveraging convolutional neural networks, autoencoders, and curriculum learning.
